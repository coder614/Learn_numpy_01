# This is the basic numpy questions with programes.
- Q1: Create a 3X3 array filled with random numbers and print its shape.
- Q2: Convert an array of floats[1.1, 2.2, 3.3] into integers.
- Q3: Use fancy indexing to extract even numbers from this array[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
- Q4: Reshape a 1D array of size 9 into a 3X3 matrix.
- Q5: Use boolean masking to filter number greater than 50 in an array.

## I can make a (.ipynb) jupyter notebook file and the sol. of each question is in a specific column.
